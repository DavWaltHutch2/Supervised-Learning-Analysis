# Supervised Learning Analysis 

This project reviews how several supervised learnng algorithms react under different scenarios. Specifically, I will review K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Boosting, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and their application to the HR Analytics Data Set and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set found on Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository respectively.  To review a detailed summary of analysis view "Supervised Learning Analysis.pdf".

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.  

### Prerequisites

To run the code you will need the R Statistical software installed on your local machine.  The code will automatically check for necessary R-packages and download any that are missing. 


### Installation

1.  Clone codebase to local machine
2.  Set working directory in R to directory labeled "code" 
3.  Run code

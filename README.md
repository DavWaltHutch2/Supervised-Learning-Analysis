# Supervised Learning Analysis 

This project reviews how several supervised learnng algorithms react under different scenarios. Specifically, I will review 1) K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  2) Decision Trees  3) Support Vector Machines (SVM)  4) Boosting  5) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  and their application to the HR Analytics Data Set and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set found on Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository respectively

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
